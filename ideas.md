  **Design Movement**: **Modern Mumbai Pop Art**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Vibrant Chaos**: Embrace the organized chaos of Indian streets but with a clean, digital twist.
  2. **Bold Typography**: Use typography as a primary visual element, mimicking street signs and hand-painted truck art.
  3. **High Contrast**: Strong contrast between background and foreground to make content pop.
  4. **Playful Authenticity**: Use illustrations and graphics that feel hand-drawn or imperfect to reflect the "street" nature.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Saffron Orange (#FF9933)**: Represents energy, spice, and the "Chai" element.
  - **Deep Teal (#006666)**: A cooling counterpoint to the spice, representing the "Thali" variety.
  - **Marigold Yellow (#FFCC00)**: For highlights and calls to action, evoking festivity.
  - **Off-White/Cream**: For backgrounds to soften the intensity and improve readability.
  - *Reasoning*: This palette captures the sensory explosion of Indian street food without being overwhelming on a screen.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Grid**: Break the standard grid with overlapping elements and off-center headings.
  - **Card-Based Staggering**: Menu items and sections appear in staggered cards rather than straight rows.
  - **Full-Width Visual Breaks**: Use large, bold typographic or illustrative sections to break up content.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Truck Art Motifs**: Floral patterns and decorative borders inspired by Indian truck art.
  - **Chai Glass Iconography**: Custom icons for menu categories (chai glass, samosa triangle, thali circle).
  - **Textured Backgrounds**: Subtle paper or wall textures to give a tactile feel.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Hover Tilts**: Cards tilt slightly on hover, adding a playful, tactile dimension.
  - **Parallax Scrolling**: Background elements move at different speeds to create depth.
  - **Cursor Effects**: A custom cursor (perhaps a small spice sprinkle) or trail.

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Elements slide in from different directions (left, right, bottom) with a bouncy easing.
  - **Scroll**: Text reveals with a "paint-on" effect or character-by-character stagger.
  - **Micro-interactions**: Buttons pulse slightly; icons wiggle on hover.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Rozha One* (High contrast serif) or *Shrikhand* (Bold, retro Gujarati style) for a distinct Indian flavor.
  - **Body**: *Poppins* or *DM Sans* (Geometric sans-serif) for modern readability and clean lines.
  - **Accents**: *Caveat* (Handwriting style) for notes and "chef's specials".

  **Design Movement**: **Neo-Traditional Minimalism**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Elevated Simplicity**: Focus on high-quality photography and negative space to let the food shine.
  2. **Cultural Elegance**: Use traditional patterns and motifs in a subtle, sophisticated way.
  3. **Warmth & Hospitality**: The design should feel inviting and cozy, like a home-cooked meal.
  4. **Storytelling**: Use the layout to tell the story of the ingredients and the chefs.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Terracotta Red (#E07A5F)**: Warm, earthy, and appetizing.
  - **Sage Green (#81B29A)**: Fresh, natural, and vegetarian-friendly.
  - **Sand/Beige (#F4F1DE)**: A neutral, warm background that feels organic.
  - **Charcoal (#3D405B)**: For text, softer than black.
  - *Reasoning*: A palette that feels grounded, organic, and sophisticated, moving away from the stereotypical bright "curry house" colors.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Split Screen**: Vertical split screens for storytelling (image on one side, text on the other).
  - **Editorial Style**: Layouts that resemble a food magazine, with large images and elegant typography.
  - **Whitespace Dominance**: Generous margins and padding to create a sense of luxury and calm.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Mandala Outlines**: Very subtle, thin-line mandala patterns as background watermarks.
  - **Gold Foil Accents**: Use a gold gradient for borders or key headings to add a touch of premium feel.
  - **Circular Frames**: Use circular image masks for dishes, mimicking the "Thali" bowls.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Smooth Fade-ins**: Content fades in gently as the user scrolls.
  - **Image Zoom**: Subtle zoom on images when hovered.
  - **Sticky Navigation**: A clean, minimal navigation bar that stays with the user.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slow & Graceful**: Transitions are slow and smooth (ease-in-out).
  - **Parallax Images**: Background images move slowly to create a cinematic feel.
  - **Line Drawing**: Decorative lines or borders draw themselves on scroll.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Playfair Display* (Elegant serif) for a premium, editorial look.
  - **Body**: *Lato* or *Mulish* (Humanist sans-serif) for warmth and readability.
  - **Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, subheadings, and body text using size and weight.

  **Design Movement**: **Spicy Brutalism**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw & Unfiltered**: Show the food as it is – messy, delicious, and real.
  2. **Maximalist Energy**: Fill the screen with color, text, and imagery. No fear of clutter.
  3. **Direct & Bold**: Communicate the value proposition (price, taste) loudly and clearly.
  4. **Street Cred**: Use visual language borrowed from street posters and flyers.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Chili Red (#D00000)**: Aggressive, appetizing, and urgent.
  - **Turmeric Yellow (#FFD700)**: Bright, high-visibility, and classic Indian.
  - **Black (#000000)**: For maximum contrast and impact.
  - **White (#FFFFFF)**: To cut through the noise.
  - *Reasoning*: A high-energy palette that demands attention and screams "street food".

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Grid Breaking**: Elements overlap, rotate, and ignore traditional boundaries.
  - **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text banners for announcements and offers.
  - **Collage Style**: Images look like they are cut out and pasted onto the screen.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Sticker Graphics**: "New", "Hot", "Best Price" badges that look like stickers.
  - **Halftone Patterns**: Comic book style dots and textures.
  - **Rough Edges**: Torn paper effects or jagged borders.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snappy & Fast**: Interactions are instant and sharp.
  - **Hover Reveals**: Hovering over text reveals an image or a different color.
  - **Draggable Elements**: Allow users to drag stickers or elements around (playful).

  **Animation**:
  - **Glitch Effects**: Occasional glitch or flicker on text.
  - **Rapid Cuts**: Images switch quickly like a stop-motion video.
  - **Bouncing**: Elements bounce into place with high elasticity.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Anton* or *Bebas Neue* (Tall, bold sans-serif) for impact.
  - **Body**: *Space Mono* or *Courier Prime* (Monospace) for a raw, industrial feel.
  - **Mix**: Mixing fonts within the same sentence for emphasis.
